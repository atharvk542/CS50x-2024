            <p>CS50 is a Computer Science course made by Harvard and taught by David Malan. It doesn't just
                teach you how to use languages like C and Python, but teaches you how to think analytically
                and how to really program. Combined with the enormous, engaged community and many resources
                available online, CS50 is one of the most accessible beginner Computer Science courses.

            <h3>How long does the course take?</h3>
            <p>It can take anywhere from one month to an entire year depending on your experience level. For me,
                since I have computer science experience, I am currently 28 days in, spending an average of 3
                hours a day, and I am almost done with 8 out of 10 weeks of the course.

            <h3>Who is eligible and how do I enroll?</h3>
            <p>Anyone is eligible to take CS50! All you need is an interest in computer science and a means to access
                the internet to take the course. To enroll, create and account sign up for the course on edX, where
                you can access the lectures, notes, and other resources from the course.

            <h3>What will I learn/gain?</h3>
            <p>
                CS50 teaches you many things. The curriculum includes programming languages of Scratch, C, Python, SQL,
                HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and Flask, with lectures in Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, and basic
                computer hardware/software concepts. More than just computers, CS50 gives you the ability to learn
                anything you want to know about computers a lot easier.

            <h3>What do you like the most about the course?</h3>
            <p>
                I personally love the way David teaches, as he clearly has experience with the course and loves the concept,
                and that shows through his lectures. They're very lengthy, yet engaging through the entire time, and very
                beginner friendly as he walks through the thought process of programs, why they work, and mistakes beginners
                commonly make.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>How hard is the course?</h3>
            <p>
                The course can be very difficult at times, requiring you to spend multiple days and even weeks on certain
                assignments, but it is overall worth it as the skills you gain from it outweigh the time you put in.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>What resources are available?</h3>
            <p>
                There are tons of resources available to CS50 students. There are many communities of people across
                platforms like Discord, Reddit, Facebook, and any other social media you can think of. On top of this,
                there are many TA's willing to guide you through your code. New this year is the CS50 duck, an AI trained
                to guide you to, not to give you, answers for your problem sets. The community surrounding CS50 in general
                is also very accepting and involved, as it is such a huge course.
